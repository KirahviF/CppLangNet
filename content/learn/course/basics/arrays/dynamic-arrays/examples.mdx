# Dynamic arrays » More examples

Now that we know how to create and use dynamic arrays, let's see some more examples.

:::note Loops
To take full advantage of what we can do with arrays, you'll need to learn about **loops**. We're going to learn about them
right after arrays. Until then in the following example we'll use only the most basic `for` loop that we've shown you already.

## Example 1:

```cpp title="Manipulating list of student grades"
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int main()
  {
    using std::vector, std::string, std::cout, std::cin;
    
    vector<string> student_names(3);
    vector<int>    student_grades(3);

    // Ask user to enter student names and grades
    cout << "Enter the first student's name:\n";
    cin  >> student_names[0];
    cout << "Enter the first student's grade:\n";
    cin  >> student_grades[0];

    cout << "Enter the second student's name:\n";
    cin  >> student_names[1];
    cout << "Enter the second student's grade:\n";
    cin  >> student_grades[1];

    cout << "Enter the third student's name:\n";
    cin  >> student_names[2];
    cout << "Enter the third student's grade:\n";
    cin  >> student_grades[2];

    // Print out the list of students and their grades
    cout << "Student list:\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < student_names.size(); i++)
      {
	      cout << student_names[i] << "\t" << student_grades[i] << "\n";
      }

  }
```
